# Computational-Biology

This GitHub recapitulates the commands that we launched on Bioclut to analyse the data. We started from a variety of fasta files, that we progressively studied and transformed. In the codes, each time the symbole FILE appears, it means that we successively replaced it by the name of the fasta files from Fredy Barneche's team. 

Firs we generated bam files, that we indexed to transformed them in bigwig files. Then, we counted the reads on specific regions of the genome of reference. 
The file 'count.txt' that appears several time was here to keep trace of the number of reads that have been counted in each situation.
